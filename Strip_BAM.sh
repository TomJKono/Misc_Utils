#	A shell script to remove all but the specified contigs or chromosomes
#	from a given bam file. Requires samtools
#	arguments:
#		-r <regions file> a file containing the regions of interest, in a 
#			format that samtools understands:
#			contig:start-stop
#			contig2:start-stop
#			With one region per line
#		-o <output directory> the directory where the new BAM files will be 
#			written. This directory should be writable. This script creates
#			a sorted BAM file and an index.
#		-b <file> BAM file to operate on

#	We give a help message if no arguments are passed
SCRIPT=`basename $0`
if (($# == 0))
then
cat << EOF
Usage:
$SCRIPT -b <file> -r <regions file> -o <output dir>
Will remove all but the regions listed from the given BAM file, and convvert
it to BAM, sort it, then index it. All files will be written to the
<output dir> specified.
